# AoC-2024 in C

This is my attempt at learning C for aoc 2024.

## To run

Create a file `session.txt` with your session cookie from adventofcode.com.

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./main <day>
```

This will run the solution for the given day, outputting the answer to stdout.
